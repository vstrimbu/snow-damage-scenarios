# snow-damage-scenarios
The code repository for the article "A long-term scenario analysis of snow damage risk: effects of reduced stand density management"

The repository has:
1. A cpp file with the snow damage functions which were added to GAYA 2.0 for this project
   
3. The configuration files that were used with GAYA 2.0 and JPL22 to run the simulations
   
5. The R script used to process the results and generate the figures.
